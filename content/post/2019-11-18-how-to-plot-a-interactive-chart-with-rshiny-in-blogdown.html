<p>#Introduction
In this short tech report, we show off how to include interactive charts into your post. We do this by deploying R-Shiny application online and embedding this withing the post. These appâ€™s are deployed on <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/" class="uri">https://www.shinyapps.io/</a>, and will be sent to this platform via the library: rsconnect.</p>
